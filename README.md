# Microbiome data analysis and visualizations with QIIME2 and R - SCRIPTS
This is a repository with the R scripts and QIIME2 commands I used in the generation of data visualizations for my Bachelor Thesis and for my final curricular internship. 

Disclaimer: I did not develop any of the software used in the analysis.
